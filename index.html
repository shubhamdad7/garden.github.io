                <p class="center">Flower gardens are another type of garden that is really common. Almost everyone on the planet is able to appreciate the fact that flowers are quite beautiful. Having a really nice flower garden on your property is going to add a significant amount of aesthetic appeal to your yard. It’s a great way to add some color to your yard and make it more interesting from a visual perspective.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Herb Gardens</h2>
                <p class="center">In the past, many people liked to grow medicinal herb gardens in order to have ingredients on hand that could be used to make medicine. With the advances in modern medicine, people don’t really grow herbs in their garden for these purposes very often. There are those who are into holistic medicinal approaches, though, and they like to keep medicinal herb gardens and make medicines in the old ways.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Indoor Gardens</h2>
                <p class="center">People who live in places that have heavy snowfall often need to turn to indoor gardening in order to get their fix. Colder climates can present difficulties for outdoor gardens, and you will only have so many months out of the year where you can viably plant things. If you have the ability to create an indoor garden area for yourself, then you will be able to garden all year round, if you so choose.</p>
